# Random-Forest
We have use Random forest Algorithm on various datasets to learn this Algorithm also as we know this also handles the classification and regression problems like decision tree. But here it combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach single result.
  Here I have used the dataset Patient_with_abnormal_Bloodpressure for building the models on Random forest.

# 1.Bloodpressure Dataset

About the Dataset ----

Here in this data we have the all necessary x-factor which we need to build the model. for more just refer to the Patient_with_abnormal_Bloodpressure CSV file where you will get idea of the variables. Here the Target variable is Blood_pressure_abnormality.

Aim of the model --

Here we are aiming to make the best predective model to give better result. here we will go for hyper parameter tuning in order
to improve model accuracy. basically here we will decide on various scenario depend upon business.
